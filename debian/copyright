Comment: Fake copyright notices
 In tests/baselines/ there are files with copyright from the Sputnik
 authors and Ecma International, pointing to a BSD-3-clause licensing,
 in an unclear way. Upstream confirmed in issue #11469 where I (J.Puydt)
 raised the question, that those were fake, raw input for the test
 framework ; hence they don't appear here.
